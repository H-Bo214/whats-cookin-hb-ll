## Abstract 
In this project, we will design an interactive web page for multiple users to store and search recipes! A user will be able to view recipe instructions, ingredients, and cost; save recipes to a 'favorites list' or 'weekly-planned' list; create a grocery list; and search/filter recipes by tag and/or type.

This project will demonstrate our understanding and implementation of ES6 classes, TDD and testing suites, HTML/CSS UX/UI design, ability to write modular, reusable code that follows SRP, using array prototypes for data manipulation, and last but certainly not least, ability to follow spec/comp to complete a functional app.

## Set Up 

1. *Fork* this repository - on the top right corner of the page, click the fork button, and clone down repo into your terminal. 
2. Since you don't want your project to be named "whats-cookin-starter-kit", add an optional argument after the repo url when cloning. The command should look like this: `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]`.
3. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies by running npm install to install project dependencies.
4. Run open src/index.html in the terminal to view and interact with the app.
